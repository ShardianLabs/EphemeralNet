# Security Policy

EphemeralNet ships signed release builds through GitHub Releases and is used to handle encrypted, time-bound data. Please follow this policy when reporting security issues.

## Supported Versions

The maintainers actively support the latest release tag (`v*`) and the current `master` branch. Older releases may not receive patches unless the issue is critical and reproducible on the latest tag.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not open a public issue or pull request for security problems.**
2. Submit a private report via the GitHub Security Advisories portal: https://github.com/ShardianLabs/EphemeralNet/security/advisories/new
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Affected EphemeralNet version or commit
   - Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
   - Impact assessment (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
   - Suggested mitigations if known

If GitHub is unavailable, you may use the "Report content" link on the repository page to reach the administrators.

## Response Process

- You will receive acknowledgement within 3 business days.
- The maintainers will investigate, develop a fix, and coordinate disclosure.
- Once a fix is available, we will cut a patched release and credit reporters who wish to be acknowledged.

Thank you for keeping EphemeralNet users safe.
