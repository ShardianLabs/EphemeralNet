# EphemeralNet TODO

## Current status
- CMake structure with base libraries and executables is in place.
- In-memory implementations of `ChunkStore`, `Node`, and `KademliaTable` now operate over the real secure transport.
- ChaCha20 symmetric encryption is integrated in `Node` and `ChunkStore` with ephemeral key management.
- Smoke test validates local chunk expiration and recovery after decryption.
- Protocol layers with Announce/Request/Chunk/Acknowledge messages and verified binary serialisation.
- Kademlia table implements LRU buckets, XOR distance, and closest-neighbour queries.
- Message authentication via HMAC-SHA256 with signing/verification helpers.
- Automatic rotation of session keys derived with HMAC-SHA256 (`KeyManager`).
- Initial key exchange based on Diffie-Hellman plus per-peer reputation tracking.
- TTL audit reporting cross-checks storage and DHT expirations.
- Cleanup manager synchronises local expirations and DHT announcement withdrawal.
- End-to-end encrypted TCP transport replaces the simulated `SessionManager`.
- Build and `ctest` succeed on MinGW-w64.
- Shamir n-of-m key sharing library with reconstruction unit tests.
- `eph://` manifest format with Base64 encode/decode and round-trip test.
- Kademlia table extended to publish and expire shard metadata with TTL.
- Shamir key sharing pipeline integrates chunk key generation, manifest creation, and DHT publication.
- `eph://` manifest ingestion and validation with key reconstruction and replicated local storage.
- Encrypted chunk request/delivery flow across peers with secure transport and signed acknowledgements.
- DHT bootstrapping with seed nodes and initial key negotiation.
- Simulated NAT traversal (UPnP/STUN/hole punching) with telemetry integrated into `Node`.
- SwarmCoordinator distributes manifests/shards with replication and rebalance plans.
- Optional persistent on-disk storage with secure TTL-driven wipe.
- Node CLI exposes `serve`, `store`, `fetch`, and `list` over the `Node` API.
- Decoupled CLI/daemon: `eph` drives the control plane with `start`, `stop`, `status`, and end-to-end launch/stop tests.
- Announce messages propagate manifest URIs and shard assignments with verified serialisation/decoding.
- SwarmCoordinator orchestrates `eph://` manifest broadcast with metadata validation and secure contact onboarding.
- Assigned fetches retry with exponential backoff, scheduled from `tick()` with pending-state cleanup.
- Fetch scheduler prioritises manifest expiry, enforces configurable concurrency, and balances per-peer requests.
- Fetch planning applies rarest-first backed by periodic availability refresh and provider counts per chunk.
- Upload choking/unchoking honours global and per-peer limits, transfer timeouts, and fair rotation.
- Seed/leecher roles tracked per chunk via `Node` ledger with multi-node transition test coverage.
- Multi-peer planning weighs availability, load, and historical roles to distribute shards fairly across the swarm and avoid choked peers.
- Protocol message version negotiation with downgrade handling and regression tests.
- Deterministic fuzz harnesses guard protocol message and manifest deserialisation paths under `ctest`.
- CLI now includes interactive confirmations (`--yes` for automation), structured error reporting, and daemon-supplied hints/codes.
- Added an MIT `LICENSE` file.
- Translated public-facing documentation to English (README, this TODO).
- CLI output, hints, and tests localised to English with compatibility for scripted confirmations.
- Authored architecture, protocol, deployment, and troubleshooting guides under `docs/`.
- Review crypto hardening (key rotation policy, TTL limits, Announce rate limiting).
- Design and implement anti-Sybil/spam defences (lightweight Proof-of-Work or equivalent for costly operations).

## Next milestones
- **CORE & PROTO**
- **SECURITY**
- **TESTING**
	- Deploy bootstrap and STUN nodes on a VPS for in-the-wild validation.
	- Build a multi-node integration harness with latency/loss simulation.
	- Automate end-to-end store/fetch scenarios with induced failures and plan rotation.
- **OPS & OBSERVABILITY**
	- Integrate structured logging and metrics exporters (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry).
	- Prepare deployment scripts and CI/CD pipelines for Windows/Linux/macOS (Docker, PPA/Copr, Homebrew).
	- Manage reproducible packaging and binary signing.
	- Define governance and abuse policies (AUP) for public bootstrap/STUN nodes and enforcement processes.
- **UX & CONFIG**
	- Add YAML/JSON configuration support with network profiles and per-environment overrides.
	- Extend input validation (paths/ports) and expose daemon hints contextually in each CLI command.
- **PRODUCT**
	- Complete the public `libephemeralnet` API (versioning, documentation, usage examples).
	- Finalise `ephemeralnet-cli` with diagnostics commands and scripting support.
	- Prototype an initial `ephemeralnet-GUI` or lightweight admin panel.
- **DOCS**
	- Publish a versioned API reference for developers embedding `libephemeralnet`.
	- Expand operator runbooks with performance tuning and capacity planning guidance.
